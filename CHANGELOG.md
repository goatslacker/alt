## 0.13.11

New:

* Added access to the internal EventEmitter used by the store. This can be access on the store instance by using `getEventEmitter()` and can be used for custom events. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/0bdb3a9a9eda43f99ebfcf5e127bf6570e045d50)
* Added a setState method for syntactic sugar which sets the state in the instance variables inside your store and then emits a change event. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/6e45ae49d23e83b3e1f67e5ef41295a09d4d097a)
* Added emitChange method. No more `this.getInstance().emitChange`, now you can just `this.emitChange()` from inside a store. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/6e45ae49d23e83b3e1f67e5ef41295a09d4d097a)
* Added syntactic sugar for waitFor. `waitFor` now takes in a splat or array of stores or dispatch tokens. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/05eb61887d2bb9ca54ae73d796743a60e6b127bc)
* The `alt` instance now gets passed to the store constructor as well as the actions constructor. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/f42b43af9afabfb56494015c0be33d9625d30284)
* ActionListener is a util that allows you to listen in on specific actions. Now it's even more lightweight if you want to listen in on a specific action but don't want the weight of a store. This comes as a util meaning it doesn't increase the size of core alt. Use it if you need it. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ce5ddcac0e40747c6df27b3960961f8cbb854daf)

Fixed:

* addStore now has the `saveStore` parameter as well. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/8e654555d9088ba6241ce713dd41234190d2ddf8)

## 0.13.10

New:

* DispatcherRecorder is a util that allows you to record and replay a series of actions. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/834ccf1718ccd6067dadbb286ca0fbbfd5510ecb)
* FinalStore is a util Store that emits a change once all other stores have emitted. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c104fb73eedd61f4c1dbd4ac074ce8a2f4b818bf)
* Added a `saveStore` parameter to `alt.createStore`. This parameter controls whether we should save the store internally (for snapshots, bootstraps) or not. Default is true. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c104fb73eedd61f4c1dbd4ac074ce8a2f4b818bf)

Fixed:

* All the mixins in the mixins folder don't make React complain about binding. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1e5ca13d93f66f6839277dadf9eb3c62989f5569)

Fixed:

* Change lifecycle hook for `Listener` mixin to `ComponentWillMount` so that it functions are identical

* Create shorthand form of `createActions`, `generateActions`. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/84e6bc40f1d7d03dc51f4f68d76bcca5b2fae748)
* Add/update several helpful mixins: `FluxyMixin`, `ReactStateMagicMixin`, and `Subscribe`. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c6acbf5deeee4aa60bd1e6bfcf590d4673926016)
