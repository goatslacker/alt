# Changelog

## 0.17.3

### Changed

* Moved hot load delete of stores up to remove the warning shown in console. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/d3befc5)

## 0.17.2

### Added

* Add `onMount` handler for AltContainer. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/189e009)

* Expose a reduce function for every store by default. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ab19ceb)

  If you're using reducers then this allows you to not ever use waitFor since you can just call store.reduce(store.getState(), payload) in order to derive data.

* Allow values for store state. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/5e18e9c)

  this.state can now be any valid JS value rather than always being an object.

* Add some reducer utils. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/f672938)

  These reducer utils can be used for easily working with reducer only stores


### Changed

* Return value from sources local method. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/3e8bb8a)

* Delete stores on hot reload. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/8485eee)

  Working with react hot loader is now simpler.

* Make fp tools faster by pulling directly from state. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/2b5adb3)

* Throw if listen does not get a function. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/193206f)

* Change the connectToStores displayName. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/b2c0b31)

* Allow listening to same action with multiple methods. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/a57d062)


## 0.17.1

### Changed

* Returning a promise from action no longer makes the action dispatch by default. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/bcda4fb)

## 0.17.0

### Breaking Changes

* Removed Symbol

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - Remove all references to Symbol, Symbol.keyFor, etc.
  - Get access to the action's unique id via `myAction.id`

* Removed `getEventEmitter()`

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - You can no longer access the internal event emitter to dispatch your own custom events. This is usually an anti-pattern.
  - If you still need this behavior you can create your own event emitter in your store.

```js
class TodoStore {
  constructor() {
    this.eventEmitter = new EventEmitter()

    this.exportPublicMethods({
      getEventEmitter: () => this.eventEmitter
    });
  }
}
```

* Removed `_storeName`.

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - `_storeName` was an internal property to the store where the store's name was kept.
  - You can now use `displayName` instead which is a public API.

* Removed `stateKey`. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/40830ea)

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - A `stateKey` property was configurable on stores as well as app level.
  - This has now been removed.
  - This key was mostly used so you can use the react-like API of `this.state`, now this is being supported first-class.

```js
// old behavior
class MyStore {
  static config = { stateKey = 'state' }

  constructor() {
    this.state = {}
  }
}
```

Now you can just use `this.state` directly. If it exists it'll be picked up.

```js
// old behavior
class MyStore {
  constructor() {
    this.state = {}
  }
}
```

The old behavior of assigning state directly as instance properties will continue to be supported. However, this new behavior will be favored in the docs.

* Render.toString/toStaticMarkup now return an object rather than a string of html.

  **Note: Render API is still in flux**

  **Upgrade Guide**

```js
// old
Render.toString(App, props).then(markup => console.log(markup))

// new
Render.toString(App, props).then(obj => console.log(obj.html))
```

* Render.toDOM no longer locks by default.

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - Render.toDOM used to "lock" meaning it wouldn't perform the fetches on the client when it rendered.
  - Now this is configurable and off by default in case you want to use Render to render client side only.

```js
// old
Render.toDOM(App, props, document.getElementById('react-root'))

// new
// the `true` is to not fetch client side.
Render.toDOM(App, props, document.getElementById('react-root'), true)
```

### Added

* A sweet new DispatcherDebugger react component which lets you debug your flux application on the browser. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ad9c2bb)
* You may now return from actions directly in order to dispatch, no need to call `this.dispatch`.
* connectToStores can now be used where you specify the methods at the callsite. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/a117e30)
* statics addon lets you add your static methods to components that have been connected. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/537ec26)

### Added

* componentDidConnect for connectToStores. Allows you to specify data fetching in there. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/464bb26)

* Hot reload of stores using webpack. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/66c875c)

### Breaking Changes

> Upgrade guide is included with each bullet point.

* New method signatures for createStore, createActions, etc. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/06838e7)

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - Previously all constructors for stores and actions received the alt instance as its first argument.
  - You now have to pass this in yourself.

```js
// old behavior

class MyStore {
  constructor(alt) { }
}
```

```js
// allows you to pass in your own arguments to the constructors

class MyStore {
  constructor(alt, one, two, three) { }
}

alt.createStore(MyStore, null, alt, 1, 2, 3)
```

* beforeEach/afterEach methods have been moved to lifecycle. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/81a4e24)

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - Previously the beforeEach and afterEach methods existed as a prototype method on the store.
  - Now they are lifecycle methods.

```js
// the new way

class Store {
  constructor() {
    this.on('beforeEach', () => {
    });
  }
}
```

* withAltContext is now in decorator form. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/3d2df4f)

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - Previously withAltContext took two arguments. The flux and the component.
  - Now it takes a single argument, flux. It returns a function which takes another argument, the component.

  As a decorator:

  ```js
  @withAltContext(alt)
  export default class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <div>{this.context.flux}</div>
    }
  }
  ```

  As a function:

  ```js
  export default withAltContext(alt)(App);
  ```

* Lifecycle method serialize and deserialize have been renamed and moved. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/fb30bbc)

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - Rename serialize to onSerialize.
  - Rename deserialize to onDeserialize.
  - Move those methods to your Store's configuration.

  ```js
  // new hotness
  class TodoStore {
    static config = {
      onSerialize() {
      },

      onDeserialize() {
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* atomicTransactions util has been renamed to just atomic. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ff6c285)

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - Change all your import/require from `alt/util/atomicTransactions` to `alt/util/atomic`

* Removed `mixins` from browser-with-addons. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ca2e40e)

Mixins are dead, all hail our new higher-order component overlords.
Please use AltContainer instead: http://alt.js.org/docs/components/altContainer/

* Method signature for beforeEach, afterEach, error lifecycle events have changed. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/0b4f3c6)

  **Upgrade Guide**

  - Previously the method signature looked like `fn(actionName, data, state)`.
  - Now it has been simplified to `fn(payload, state)` where `payload` is an object.
  - The payload object contains keys `action` and `data` which contain the information from before.

```js
class Store {
  constructor() {
    this.on('beforeEach', (payload, state) => {
      console.log(payload.data);
    });
  }
}
```

### Added

* Time Traveling! [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/013447d)

```js
@timetravel
class TodoStore { }

TodoStore.undo(3);
TodoStore.redo(1);
```

* connectToStores function which also works with decorators. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/aedabf4)

```js
@connectToStores
class TodoApp extends React.Component {
  static getStores() {
    return [TodoStoreStore]
  }
  static getPropsFromStores(props) {
    return TodoStore.getState()
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.todos.map(todo => <Todo todo={todo} />}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

* ImmutableJS support, in an addon as a decorator. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/78ef8bf)

```js
@immutable
class TodoStore {
  constructor() {
    this.state = Immutable.Map({})
  }
}
```

* Use store references to take snapshots. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/a25f2c8)

```js
alt.takeSnapshot(TodoStore); // returns only TodoStore's snapshot
```

* Use store references to recycle. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/0563352)

```js
alt.recycle(TodoStore); // recycles only TodoStore
```

* Simple decorators for creating stores and actions. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c06147e)

```js
import { createStore } from 'alt/utils/decorators'

@createStore(alt)
export default class TodoStore {
  constructor() {
  }
}
```

* Apply transforms at the app level to modify each store before it is created. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1a6f528)

```js
alt.stateTransforms.push(Store => {
  // make every store atomic
  return atomic(alt)(Store)
})
```

* Add specific configuration to your stores, like how getState and setState behave. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1de5e95)

```js
class TodoStore {
  static config = {
    getState(state) {
      // adds a new todo every time you getState
      return states.todos.push({ 'Another todo!' });
    }
  }
}
```

* Create your actions inside the constructor by using instance properties. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/752995d)

```js
class FooActions {
  constructor() {
    this.myAction = function (x) {
      this.dispatch(x);
    };
  }
}
```

* All actions created are now available in `alt.actions`. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1d32ad9)

* `inject` prop to AltContainer. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/14b56aa)

```js
// inject lets you inject arbitrary props to your children

<AltContainer inject={{ foo: 7, bar: 'hello' }}>
  <div />
</AltContainer>

// div gets prop foo=7 and bar='hello'
```

* `component` prop to AltContainer. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/653cb29)

* alt has a `prepare` method which prepares a payload for bootstrapping. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c56d0bf)

```js
// rather than rendering its children you can now pass in a component

<AltContainer component={MyComponent} />

// equivalent to

<AltContainer>
  <MyComponent />
</AltContainer>
```

* Allow customizing where you assign your state as a key. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ff9e4dd)

```js
// if you yearn for a react-like API you can now has

const alt = new Alt({ stateKey: 'state' });

class Store {
  constructor() {
    this.state = {
      stateGoesHere: 1,
      yay: 2
    };

    this.nowItsPrivate = true;
  }
}
```

* An [ES5 guide](http://alt.js.org/guides/es5/) now exists. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/8d4ec48)

* Customizable setState and getState. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/60c11b6)

```js
// Customize the way getState and setState behave at the app level.

const alt = new Alt({
  getState(state) {
    // add fuzzlewuzzle to every state
    state.fuzzlewuzzle = true;
    return state;
  },

  setState(existingState, newState) {
    // forget existingState, in with the new out with the old
    return newState;
  }
});
```

* Added `maxEvents` parameter to DispatcherRecorder. This allows you to specify how many events you wish to record. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/5237b69)

### Fixes

### Added

* Added access to the internal EventEmitter used by the store. This can be access on the store instance by using `getEventEmitter()` and can be used for custom events. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/0bdb3a9a9eda43f99ebfcf5e127bf6570e045d50)
* Added a setState method for syntactic sugar which sets the state in the instance variables inside your store and then emits a change event. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/6e45ae49d23e83b3e1f67e5ef41295a09d4d097a)
* Added emitChange method. No more `this.getInstance().emitChange`, now you can just `this.emitChange()` from inside a store. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/6e45ae49d23e83b3e1f67e5ef41295a09d4d097a)
* Added syntactic sugar for waitFor. `waitFor` now takes in a splat or array of stores or dispatch tokens. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/05eb61887d2bb9ca54ae73d796743a60e6b127bc)
* The `alt` instance now gets passed to the store constructor as well as the actions constructor. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/f42b43af9afabfb56494015c0be33d9625d30284)
* ActionListener is a util that allows you to listen in on specific actions. Now it's even more lightweight if you want to listen in on a specific action but don't want the weight of a store. This comes as a util meaning it doesn't increase the size of core alt. Use it if you need it. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ce5ddcac0e40747c6df27b3960961f8cbb854daf)

### Fixed

* addStore now has the `saveStore` parameter as well. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/8e654555d9088ba6241ce713dd41234190d2ddf8)

* FinalStore is a util Store that emits a change once all other stores have emitted. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c104fb73eedd61f4c1dbd4ac074ce8a2f4b818bf)
* Added a `saveStore` parameter to `alt.createStore`. This parameter controls whether we should save the store internally (for snapshots, bootstraps) or not. Default is true. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c104fb73eedd61f4c1dbd4ac074ce8a2f4b818bf)
